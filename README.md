# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to ascertain the relationship between funding levels and launchdates for theater projects. 
### Purpose
I was looking for evidence of relationships between types of campaigns, types of projects, and funding cycles
## Analysis and Challenges
The data provide some insight as to the relative success and failure of Kickstarter Campaigns. However, a challenge arises when any attempt is made to refine the data. For example, "Successful" and "Failed" are broad, all encompassing terms that do not account for change overtime. Effetively, we can determine whether or not a project met its goals but we cannot determine if the project itself was successful. This discrepancy is due to a number of factors. First, we have no paramters for successful or unsuccesful projects beyond the baseline criteria of whether or not they achieved their funding goals. A project may have achieved its funding goals but have been cancelled three months into its production, how would we account for such an instance? Similarly, how would we account for a scenario wherein a project was funded, made it through its initial production run but never achieved its desired levels of viewership or engagement? In such an instance we would require data for length of production, audience levels, desired audience levels, audience tastes or preferences, and how these data points reflect different types of projects. This lack of insight is also present in the current Kickstarter data set as well. For example, we have little to no data that attempts to account for different audience prefernce across age, gender, education, and location, among other factors. In effect, this is all to say that measuring success and failure by the basic criteria of whether or not a project met its initial funding goals speaks little to the projects long term viability. In effect all this data can really tell us is how likely a project is to make it past the initial funding stages. An extensive amount of qualitative data is needed to go beyond initial funding viability and provide a more holistic image of long term success.\
We can see this discrepancy in theater projects, in the chart below there is a significant gap in the "live" and "canceled" lines that offer little insight into why these projects failed\

## Results
Despite the challenges presented by the data, we can draw conclusions about a project's initial viability from the information available. 
### Theater Outcomes vs. Launch Dates
Two possible conclusions we can draw about the viability of theater projects based on Kickstarter Launch dates are as follows\
1. _**The first fiscal quarter of the year is a suboptimal time in which to launch a kickstarter campaign.**_ Despite a slight increase in succesful campaigns from january to February, the general trend suggests that this no more than a false dawn, or rather, this brief period of success can give project managers a mistaken belief that they have a reasonable chance of success. This is evidenced by the Twenty Two percent decrease in successful campaigns from February to March which effectively nullifies the same increase from January to February.
2. **_The Second Fiscal Quarter offers a much greater chance at success_** The same dats suggests that launching a Kickstarter Campaign in the second quarter (April-May) provides the greatest chance at success. In addition, launhcing a funding campaign in the third quarter, while not as successful as the second, still provides a greater overall chance of success than in the first as seen in the chart below.

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Broadly speaking, the most succesful campaigns were those in which less than $1000 was required for initial launch of the project. This is the only data point in which we can see that offers a success rate of greater than fifty percent.

### Summary of Limitations
As stated previously, a challenge arises when any attempt is made to refine the data. For example, "Successful" and "Failed" are broad, all encompassing terms that do not account for change overtime. Effetively, we can determine whether or not a project met its goals but we cannot determine if the project itself was successful. This discrepancy is due to a number of factors. First, we have no paramters for successful or unsuccesful projects beyond the baseline criteria of whether or not they achieved their funding goals.

In such an instance we would require data for length of production, audience levels, desired audience levels, audience tastes or preferences, and how these data points reflect different types of projects. This lack of insight is also present in the current Kickstarter data set as well. For example, we have little to no data that attempts to account for different audience prefernce across age, gender, education, and location, among other factors.
